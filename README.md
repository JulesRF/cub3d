The subject also asks you to render differents maps located in ".cub" extension files.
Those files can be created or modified by the user so the programm need to carefuly parse the input.

The user can draw his own map using 1 characters as wall and 0 characters as floor, the rest is empty.
He can also choose the color of the floor, ceiling, and can add textures to render on the walls
